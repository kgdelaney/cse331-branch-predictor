  Define all your tables and their sizes here.

  Please don't call malloc () or any of its relatives within your

  (not bytes).  That encompasses all storage (all tables, plus GHR, if
  necessary -- but not PC) used for the predictor.  That may not be
  the amount of storage your predictor uses, however -- for example,
  you may implement 2-bit predictors with a table of ints, in which
  case the simulator will use more memory -- that's okay, we're only
  concerned about the memory used by the simulated branch predictor.
